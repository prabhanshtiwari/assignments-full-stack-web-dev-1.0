/*
Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
as input and uses the conditional(ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the 
temperature is above 30*C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

var current_temperature = 31;

weather_condition = (current_temperature > 30) ? "Hot" : "Moderate";

console.log("Current temperature :", current_temperature);
console.log("Weather condition :", weather_condition);
