Q4. Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
Answer:

The comma operator in JavaScript is used to combine multiple expressions into a single statement. 
It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the last expression. 
While it is less commonly used, it can be helpful in situations where you want to compactly express 
several operations within a single line of code.

One common use case is in the initialization and iteration parts of a for loop. 
Here's an example:

for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < 5; i++, j--) {
    console.log(i, j);
  }

In this example:

let i = 0, j = 10; initializes two variables (i and j) using the comma operator.
i++ increments the value of i in each iteration.
j-- decrements the value of j in each iteration.
console.log(i, j); prints the values of i and j in each iteration.
